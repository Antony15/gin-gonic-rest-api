# wednesday-go-test

API that provides a REST interface for the following business
requirements:
• A user should be able to request a booking for a cab from pickup location A to pickup location B
• A user should be able to view his past bookings
• A user should be able to get cabs that are nearby.

These requirements are a subset of the needs of a cab booking platform like
Uber/Ola.

Brownie points for:
• Used JSON API
• Test driven development
• Written middleware for proper http error statuses
• Used gin framework
• Used mysql for rdbms
